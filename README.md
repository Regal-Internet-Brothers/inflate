# inflate
This is a *work-in-progress* port of the [Tiny Inflate](https://bitbucket.org/jibsen/tinf) C Library, as seen in '[uzlib](https://github.com/pfalcon/uzlib)'. This is not in working order yet, so don't try it in anything stable. Outputs seem to be skewed at present, so the algorithm is not properly implemented.

This depends on [the 'regal' modules project](https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/regal-modules), so if you're interested in this, you'll need those as well.
